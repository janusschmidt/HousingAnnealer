# Board Annealer

Uses simulated annealing to solve the following problem.

## Problem

In an 8 by 8 grid place as many houses as possibly. Only one house per cell. A house must not have more neighbouring 
cells with houses than neighbouring cells with no houses. A diagonal adjacent cell is counted as a neighbour.

## Result

- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
- 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
- 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
- 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
- 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
